Glue is a serverless service where you just need to focus on writing your code and everything will be taken care of by AWS\n\n✅ Amazon Redshift:\nSo you processed data and wrote the ETL script, where to load it? Yes! Data Warehouse. Amazon Redshift is a fully managed data warehouse service that makes it simple to analyze all your data using standard SQL and your preferred business intelligence (BI) tools.\n\n✅ Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce):\nMaybe you already have your processing scripts on on-premise servers written in Hadoop/Spark and want to migrate to a similar system then EMR is the way to go.\n\nIt is a managed big data platform that makes it easy to process large amounts of data using open-source data processing frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.\n\n✅ AWS Lambda:\nWant to run quick scripts on specific times/triggers/events? Lambda is your best friend!\n\nAWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that enables you to run your code without managing servers. This service can be used to run data engineering workflows and transform data in real time.\n\n✅ Amazon Athena:\nWhy load data on Data Warehouse, when you can just direct run SQL query on top of actual files? Athena is an ad-hoc query interface that you can use for SQL queries directly on top of files stored on S3 buckets\n\n✅ Kinesis:\nWant to process real-time data, analyze it and store it? Kinesis is used for this type of work, just like Apache Kafka, you can process real-time data using Kinesis.\n\n✅ DMS (Data Migration Service):\nI spent my early data engineering days working on migration projects and DMS makes your life so much easier.\n\nThere are many more services you can focus on such as EC2, IAM, VPC, Batch, Sagemaker, etc...\n\nYou can watch the detailed video here - https://lnkd.in/dDYvTudr\n\nDid I miss something?

Instead, focus on understanding consumers and adapting to their changing needs  \n\n🎯 Good leadership means strong communication and empowering your team \n\n🎯 Failure is not a terminal end, but rather a part of the journey towards success \n\n🎯 Constantly reinvent yourself and work with new people to stay out of your comfort zone \n\n#Entrepreneurship #Success #Leadership  ",

Leadership and responsibility: \n\nTaking ownership of your actions, leading by example, and being accountable for the success or failure of your ventures.\n\n2. Continuous learning and growth: \n\nEmbracing a mindset of constant improvement, seeking knowledge, and adapting to new challenges and market dynamics.\n\n3. Emphasizing personal fulfillment: \n\nFinding fulfillment and purpose in pursuing entrepreneurial endeavors that align with one's passions, values, and personal aspirations.\n\n4. Building relationships and networks: \n\nCultivating connections with mentors, partners, customers, and other entrepreneurs to collaborate, learn, and grow together.\n\n5. Embracing the journey, not just the destination: \n\nRecognizing that entrepreneurship is not solely about achieving specific milestones or financial gains, but also about enjoying the process, personal growth, and the pursuit of meaningful goals.\n\nThese seven years have changed my entire perspective.\n \nIt's a journey that has taught me valuable lessons about myself, others, and the world around me. \n\nEntrepreneurs, how has your view of entrepreneurship changed over time?\n\n#leadership #success #entrepreneurship #connections #entrepreneurs  #startup #mindset ",

With Kestra, workflows are defined using YAML, allowing for a more intuitive and user-friendly approach.\n\nWhy should you take notice of Kestra? Here's why:\n\n🔧 Declarative Workflows: Define the desired state and outcome of a data workflow, instead of providing step-by-step instructions. Adapt to changing requirements easily without re-writing code.\n\n⚙️ YAML for Workflow Definition: Leveraging the simplicity of YAML, Kestra offers a human-readable format that's easy to manage, maintain, and understand.\n\n🚀 Distributed Execution: With its modern architecture, Kestra provides a robust environment for large-scale data processing tasks.\n\n🔐 Secure and Reliable: Kestra ensures data integrity and resilience, with built-in fault tolerance and retry mechanisms.\n\n💼 Integration Capabilities: Seamlessly integrates with modern data tools such as DBT, Airbyte, Snowflake, Fivetran, and more.\n\nKestra is open-source and can be quickly set up using Docker or Kubernetes. With extensive documentation and a growing community, getting started has never been easier!\n\nIt is very exciting tool for sure and you would be interested to know more about it's core capabilities, I have written a detailed blog for the same, check the first comment 👇\n\n#Kestra #DeclarativeWorkflows #DataOrchestration #DataScience #DataEngineering #OpenSource #YAML #TechNews",

They are the time when I can relax, recharge and reconnect with myself and the people I love. Here is how I usually spend my weekends:\n\n1) I wake up in the morning at 7 and I do one yoga session. It helps me to stay focused and increase the concentration. Yoga also keeps me fit and healthy.\n\n2) Then I do 15-20 mins of meditation. Meditation calms my mind and reduces stress. It also improves my mood and creativity.\n\n3) Then I start my day by having a breakfast. I like to have something nutritious and delicious, like oatmeal, fruits, or toast.\n\n4) Then I pick up a newspaper or any book I am reading for that week. Like for this week I am reading \"Dreams with the eyes open by Ronnie Screwvala\". I read for 30 to 45 mins. Reading expands my knowledge and perspective. It also inspires me to learn new things and pursue my goals.\n\n4) Then I go for any outing with friends if we have plans. For the whole week everyone in the friend circle worked really hard. \nOuting plays an important role in my life as it gives me a chance to explore new places, meet people and exchange ideas. It also makes me happy and grateful for the friendships I have.\n\n5) Then I come back and have dinner with family as family time is important. We talk about our day, share our stories and laugh together. Sometimes we watch Kapil Sharma comedy show as laughter is the best medicine.\n\nThis is how I spend my weekends.A lot of you always ask me who did I nourish my body, mind and soul? This what I do to be more productive, creative and joyful during the week.\n\nWhat about you? How do you spend your weekends? Let me know in the comments below.",

      "content": "Remember King Bruce and the spider? One story I was fascinated by as a kid, was that of the never-give-up attitude of a spider, who failed six times before trying again a seventh time and succeeding in spinning a web. King Bruce took inspiration from it to fight a seventh time and win back Scotland from England, after losing battles six times earlier.\n\nI had a chance meeting with Aditya Kothari, a dear friend from our early startup days, last weekend. I remember Aditya as a relentless entrepreneur who never gives up, much like King Bruce and the spider. Take a look at his profile, and you will see six startup attempts over a decade from 2010 to 2020. \n\nWhen I first met him over breakfast in 2014, I was running marketing at Momoe, the mobile payments app. We chatted about growth hacking, and I could see that he had been there, done that several times. We talked about the high costs of doing marketing activations at IT Parks, and he had a brilliant idea of using branded teacups at chai tapris around IT campuses. This evolved into the viral \"Dhai Ki Chai\" campaign, where we got chai tapris to accept digital payments and converted a lot of IT employees into Momoe users at almost zero marketing cost.\n\nAditya tried entrepreneurship six times with varying degrees of success and failure, and then used all his learnings the seventh time to start Chingari, the social app sensation, in 2020. He grew Chingari to 140 million users across the country, with a fraction of the marketing costs that other such apps had to bleed.\n\nSpeaking to Aditya with his everlasting smile, it was back to reminiscing about the early days as marketers a decade ago. I still see the twinkle in his eye, the energy in his attitude, and the keeda to do something out-of-the-box all over again. \n\nIt was great catching up, dear friend. Take a well deserved break, and know that the world is waiting to see what you will do next to put a dent in it.\n\n#startups #entrepreneurship #marketing #growthhacking",

Concentrate on results. Otherwise, talented people will always leave.\n\nAGREE GUYS ?

In a world of AI-guided trading chatbots that help to offload the mental energy for where to invest, this was a unique way to learn and understand how to evaluate stocks.\n \nIt was an interesting opportunity to go beyond the engineering discipline and try something new 😊.
